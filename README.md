# RustCode

A collection of basic Rust programs exploring concurrency concepts including deadlocks, multithreading, and race conditions.

## What's Inside

This repository contains simple examples and exercises covering:

- **Multithreading**: Basic thread creation and management
- **Deadlocks**: Demonstration of deadlock scenarios and prevention
- **Race Conditions**: Examples of race conditions and synchronization solutions

## Purpose

These are learning exercises to understand Rust's approach to memory safety and concurrency. Each example focuses on a specific concept with minimal, easy-to-understand code.

## Technologies Used

- Rust
- Standard library threading primitives
- Cargo build system

## Learning Goals

- Understanding Rust's ownership model
- Exploring thread safety mechanisms
- Practicing concurrent programming patterns
- Learning to identify and prevent common concurrency issues
